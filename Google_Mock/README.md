## Introduction Mocking
* Mocking is a type of test double that usually means replacing a `real` project with a `fake` one.
* It's used to isolate the class under test from its dependencies.
* So you can check that method was called or not with what parameters and so on.
#### For example:
If you are testing a class that does some database operations, you don't want to make `real` changes to the database.
